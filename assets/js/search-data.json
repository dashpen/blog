            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outlength is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedocode to python | . outlengthTemp = 94 def convertFahrenheit(celsius): # code goes here return (celsius - 32) * 5 / 9 convertFahrenheit(outlengthTemp) . 34.44444444444444 . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . quizGrade = 60 print(quizGrade) def replaceGrade(currentPoints): global quizGrade currentGrade = currentPoints / 40 currentGrade = currentGrade * 100 if (currentGrade &gt; quizGrade): quizGrade = currentGrade replaceGrade(34) print(quizGrade) . 60 85.0 . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | .

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? # will print one . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? # may print more than once . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sun = 1 counter = 3 for each in range(4): sun = sun + counter counter += 2 print(sun) . 25 . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | Ex: see Example A . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: .

What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . (IMAGE HERE) . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . (IMAGE HERE) . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . (IMAGE HERE) . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | .

Iteration: If a condition is true, then the code can repeat. | . Algorithms Can Be Represented in Two Ways . Flowcharts: Use shapes and arrows to represent the steps of an algorithm. | . . Pseudocode: A blend of human language and coding format. | Hacks: Jamboard Flowchart . Click on this link for a group activity . . . Arithmetic Operations . Arithmetic operations exist in most programming languages. . Basic Operations . Subtraction: . Represented by “-&quot; | . num1 = 2 - 1 . Addition: . Represented by &quot;+&quot; | . num1 = 2 + 1 . Multiplication: . Represented by “*” | . num1 = 2 * 1 . Division: . Represented by “/” | . num1 = 2 / 1 . Getting the Remainder: . Represented by “MOD” (% in python) | . num1 = 5 % 2 . Different Uses . Items can be numbers or variables. . Examples: . num1 = 10 num2 = num1 - 25 num3 = 100 * num1 num4 = num1 / num2 num5 = 9 % num4 . Order of Operations . Arithmetic operations in programming are performed in the same order as operations in mathematics: . Operations in parentheses should be done first. . | Division and multiplication should be done before addition and subtraction. . | Modulus works similar to multiplication and division. . | . Example: Evaluate num1 . num1 = 9 % 2 * ( 8 - 2 ) + 8 / ( 6 - 4 ) print(num1) . 10.0 . . . Variables . Different Ways Values are Stored in Variables .

Sequencing is Important! . Changing the order of the steps changes the overall outcome, since every time the value assigned to a variable is changed, it overrides the last value which was assigned to the same variable. That is why it is important to track the value of variables, especially in code where the value is constantly changing. . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 + num3 # num1 is now 4 + 6, which is 10 num2 = num1 + num3 # num2 is now (the new num1) 10 + 6, which is 16 # output: num1 = 10, num2 = 16, num3 = 6 . VS . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num2 = num1 + num3 #num2 is now 8 num1 = num2 + num3 # num1 is now 14 # output: num1 = 14, num2 = 8, num3 = 6 . Tracking Variables . Tracking variables is a common question found on AP exams and is an important thing to keep in mind when writing any code. If the value of your variables changes a lot, not accounting for these changes can result in an unwanted outcome. . var1 = 9 var2 = 7 var3 = 2 #var = var1 + 5 #var2 = var1 - var3 #var1 = var2 #var3 = (var1 + var2) / 2 #var2 = 6 print(var1) print(var2) print(var3) .

A string is a collection of characters. What is a character as character can be anything from numbers, letters, spaces, special symbols, etc. . Certain procedures may be used with strings and they vary from programming language to language Python examples . len() to find the length of a string . lower() to convert to lowercase . etc. Pseudocode examples . len() returns the length of a string . concat() returns a string made up of the concatenated strings ex. concat(&quot;string1&quot;, &quot;string2&quot;) would return string1string2 . substring() returns the characters from the string beginning at the at the first position to the last so an example of this would be substring (&quot;abcdefghijk&quot;, 2, 5) would print bcde (pseudocode starts at 1) . String Concatenation . What is string concatenation? . String concatenation is combining 2 or more strings to make a new strings in order to create a new string . concat() in pseudocode and varys from language to language can be used to combine to strings such as concat(&quot;cookie&quot;,&quot;monster&quot;) returns cookiemonster . Substrings . What is a substring? . A substring is a part of and already existing string. . In pseudocode substring() method is used for instance for concat(&quot;Mr.Mortenson is very handsome&quot; 1, 2) the system would return Mr (remember that pseudocode starts at 1) . Hacks . Find the result of the following problems. Then convert the pseudocode to working python code using your knowledge of python string operators. . Problem 1 . Noun = &quot;Mr.Mortenson&quot; Adjective = &quot;handsome&quot; Adjective2 = &quot;Very&quot; Verb = &quot;is&quot; abrev = &quot;Mort&quot; print(Adjective2 + &quot; &quot;+ Adjective+ &quot; &quot;+ abrev+ &quot; &quot; + Verb + &quot;.&quot;) . Very handsome Mort is. . Problem 2 . cookie = &quot;choclate&quot; cookie2 = &quot;rasin&quot; len1 = str(len(cookie)/2) len2 = str(len(cookie2) * 45 ) vote1 = cookie + &quot;vote&quot; + len2 vote2 = cookie2 + &quot;vote&quot; + len1 votes = vote1 + &quot; &quot; + vote2 print(votes) # len1 = cookie / 2 # len2 = cookie2 * 45 # vote1 = (cookie, &quot;vote&quot;, len2) # vote2 = (cookie2, &quot;vote&quot;, len1) # votes = (concat(vote1, &quot; &quot;, vote2)) # print(votes) . choclatevote225 rasinvote4.0 .",

I’ll leave now. . # . # . - Wait! How did you learn to do that? . - What? . # . # . The talking thing. . # . # . Same way you did, I guess. . “Mama, Dada, honey.” You pick it up. . # . # . - That’s very funny. . - Yeah. . # . # . Bees are funny.

The wedding is on. . # . # . And he says, “Watermelon? . I thought you said Guatemalan. . # . # . Why would I marry a watermelon?” . # . # . Is that a bee joke? . # . # . That’s the kind of stuff we do. . # . # . Yeah, different. . # . # . So, what are you gonna do, Barry? . # . # . About work? I don’t know. . # . # . I want to do my part for the hive, . but I can’t do it the way they want. . # . # . I know how you feel. . # . # . - You do? . - Sure. . # . # . My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or . a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. . # . # . - Really? . - My only interest is flowers. . # . # .

She saved my life! . And she understands me. . # . # . This is over! . # . # . Eat this. . # . # . This is not over!

Dumb bees! . # . # . You must want to sting all those jerks. . # . # . We try not to sting. . It’s usually fatal for us. . # . # . So you have to watch your temper. . # . # . Very carefully. . You kick a wall, take a walk, . # . # . write an angry letter and throw it out. . Work through it like any emotion: . # . # . Anger, jealousy, lust. . # . # . Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? . # . # .

Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, . # . # . we’ll have three former queens here in . our studio, discussing their new book, . # . # . Olassy Ladies, . out this week on Hexagon. . # . # . Tonight we’re talking to Barry Benson. . # . # . Did you ever think, “I’m a kid . from the hive. I can’t do this”? . # . # . Bees have never been afraid . to change the world. . # . # . What about Bee Oolumbus? . Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? . # . # . Where I’m from, we’d never sue humans. . # . # . We were thinking . of stickball or candy stores. . # . # . How old are you? . # . # . The bee community . is supporting you in this case, . # . # . which will be the trial . of the bee century. . # . # . You know, they have a Larry King . in the human world too. . # . # . It’s a common name. Next week… . # . # . He looks like you and has a show . and suspenders and colored dots… . # . # . Next week… . # . # .

Yes, and Adam here . has been a huge help. . # . # . - Frosting… . - How many sugars? . # . # . Just one. I try not . to use the competition. . # . # . So why are you helping me? . # . # . Bees have good qualities. . # . # . And it takes my mind off the shop. . # . # . Instead of flowers, people . are giving balloon bouquets now. . # . # . Those are great, if you’re three. . # . # . And artificial flowers. . # . # . - Oh, those just get me psychotic! . - Yeah, me too. . # . # . Bent stingers, pointless pollination. . # . # . Bees must hate those fake things! . # . # . Nothing worse . than a daffodil that’s had work done. . # . # . Maybe this could make up . for it a little bit. . # . # . - This lawsuit’s a pretty big deal. . - I guess. . # . # . You sure you want to go through with it? . # . # . Am I sure? When I’m done with . the humans, they won’t be able . # . # . to say, “Honey, I’m home,” . without paying a royalty! . # . # . It’s an incredible scene . here in downtown Manhattan, . # . # . where the world anxiously waits, . because for the first time in history, . # . # . we will hear for ourselves . if a honeybee can actually speak. . # . # . What have we gotten into here, Barry? . # . # . It’s pretty big, isn’t it? . # . # . I can’t believe how many humans . don’t work during the day. . # . # . You think billion-dollar multinational . food companies have good lawyers? . # . # . Everybody needs to stay . behind the barricade. . # . # . - What’s the matter? . - I don’t know, I just got a chill. . # . # . Well, if it isn’t the bee team. . # . # . You boys work on this? . # . # . All rise! The Honorable . Judge Bumbleton presiding. . # . # . All right. Oase number 4475, . # . # . Superior Oourt of New York, . Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry . # . # . is now in session. . # . # . Mr. Montgomery, you’re representing . the five food companies collectively? . # . # . A privilege. . # . # . Mr. Benson… you’re representing . all the bees of the world? . # . # . I’m kidding. Yes, Your Honor, . we’re ready to proceed. . # . # . Mr. Montgomery, . your opening statement, please. . # . # . Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, . # . # . my grandmother was a simple woman. . # . # . Born on a farm, she believed . it was man’s divine right . # . # . to benefit from the bounty . of nature God put before us. . # . # . If we lived in the topsy-turvy world . Mr. Benson imagines, . # . # . just think of what would it mean. . # . # . I would have to negotiate . with the silkworm . # . # . for the elastic in my britches! . # . # . Talking bee! . # . # . How do we know this isn’t some sort of . # . # . holographic motion-picture-capture . Hollywood wizardry? . # . # . They could be using laser beams! . # . # . Robotics! Ventriloquism! . Oloning! For all we know, . # . # . he could be on steroids! . # . # . Mr. Benson? . # . # . Ladies and gentlemen, . there’s no trickery here. . # . # . I’m just an ordinary bee. . Honey’s pretty important to me. . # . # . It’s important to all bees. . We invented it! . # . # . We make it. And we protect it . with our lives. . # . # . Unfortunately, there are . some people in this room . # . # . who think they can take it from us . # . # . ‘cause we’re the little guys! . I’m hoping that, after this is all over, . # . # . you’ll see how, by taking our honey, . you not only take everything we have . # . # . but everything we are! . # . # . I wish he’d dress like that . all the time. So nice! . # . # . Oall your first witness. . # . # . So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden . of Honey Farms, big company you have. . # . # . I suppose so. . # . # . I see you also own . Honeyburton and Honron! . # . # . Yes, they provide beekeepers . for our farms. . # . # . Beekeeper. I find that . to be a very disturbing term. . # . # . I don’t imagine you employ . any bee-free-ers, do you? . # . # . - No. . - I couldn’t hear you. . # . # . - No. . - No. . # . # . Because you don’t free bees. . You keep bees. Not only that, . # . # . it seems you thought a bear would be . an appropriate image for a jar of honey. . # . # . They’re very lovable creatures. . # . # . Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. . # . # . You mean like this? . # . # . Bears kill bees! . # . # . How’d you like his head crashing . through your living room?! . # . # . Biting into your couch! . Spitting out your throw pillows! . # . # . OK, that’s enough. Take him away. . # . # . So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. . Your name intrigues me. . # . # . - Where have I heard it before? . - I was with a band called The Police. . # . # . But you’ve never been . a police officer, have you? . # . # . No, I haven’t. . # . # . No, you haven’t. And so here . we have yet another example . # . # . of bee culture casually . stolen by a human . # . # . for nothing more than . a prance-about stage name. . # . # . Oh, please. . # . # . Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? . # . # . Because I’m feeling . a little stung, Sting. . # . # . Or should I say… Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! . # . # . That’s not his real name?! You idiots! . # . # . Mr. Liotta, first, . belated congratulations on . # . # . your Emmy win for a guest spot . on ER in 2005. . # . # . Thank you. Thank you. . # . # . I see from your resume . that you’re devilishly handsome . # . # . with a churning inner turmoil . that’s ready to blow. . # . # . I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? . # . # . Not yet it isn’t. But is this . what it’s come to for you? . # . # . Exploiting tiny, helpless bees . so you don’t . # . # . have to rehearse . your part and learn your lines, sir? . # . # . Watch it, Benson! . I could blow right now! . # . # . This isn’t a goodfella. . This is a badfella! . # . # . Why doesn’t someone just step on . this creep, and we can all go home?! . # . # . - Order in this court! . - You’re all thinking it! . # . # . Order! Order, I say! . # . # . - Say it! . - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! . # . # . I think it was awfully nice . of that bear to pitch in like that. . # . # . I think the jury’s on our side. . # . # . Are we doing everything right, legally? . # . # . I’m a florist. . # . # . Right. Well, here’s to a great team. . # . # . To a great team! . # . # . Well, hello. . # . # . - Ken! . - Hello. . # . # . I didn’t think you were coming. . # . # . No, I was just late. . I tried to call, but… the battery. . # . # . I didn’t want all this to go to waste, . so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. . # . # . Oh, that was lucky. . # . # . There’s a little left. . I could heat it up. . # . # . Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. . # . # . So I hear you’re quite a tennis player. . # . # . I’m not much for the game myself. . The ball’s a little grabby. . # . # . That’s where I usually sit. . Right… there. . # . # . Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, . # . # . and he agreed with me that eating with . chopsticks isn’t really a special skill. . # . # . You think I don’t see what you’re doing? . # . # . I know how hard it is to find . the rightjob. We have that in common. . # . # . Do we? . # . # . Bees have 100 percent employment, . but we do jobs like taking the crud out. . # . # . That’s just what . I was thinking about doing. . # . # . Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor . for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. . # . # . I’m going to drain the old stinger. . # . # . Yeah, you do that. . # . # . Look at that. . # . # . You know, I’ve just about had it . # . # . with your little mind games. . # . # . - What’s that? . - Italian Vogue. . # . # . Mamma mia, that’s a lot of pages. . # . # . A lot of ads. . # . # . Remember what Van said, why is . your life more valuable than mine? . # . # . Funny, I just can’t seem to recall that! . # . # . I think something stinks in here! . # . # . I love the smell of flowers. . # . # . How do you like the smell of flames?! . # . # . Not as much. . # . # . Water bug! Not taking sides! . # . # . Ken, I’m wearing a Ohapstick hat! . This is pathetic! . # . # . I’ve got issues! . # . # . Well, well, well, a royal flush! . # . # . - You’re bluffing. . - Am I? . # . # . Surf’s up, dude! . # . # . Poo water! . # . # . That bowl is gnarly. . # . # . Except for those dirty yellow rings! . # . # . Kenneth! What are you doing?! . # . # . You know, I don’t even like honey! . I don’t eat it! . # . # . We need to talk! . # . # . He’s just a little bee! . # . # . And he happens to be . the nicest bee I’ve met in a long time! . # . # . Long time? What are you talking about?! . Are there other bugs in your life? . # . # . No, but there are other things bugging . me in life. And you’re one of them! . # . # . Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night… . # . # . My nerves are fried from riding . on this emotional roller coaster! . # . # . Goodbye, Ken. . # . # . And for your information, . # . # . I prefer sugar-free, artificial . sweeteners made by man! . # . # . I’m sorry about all that. . # . # . I know it’s got . an aftertaste! I like it! . # . # . I always felt there was some kind . of barrier between Ken and me. . # . # . I couldn’t overcome it. . Oh, well. . # . # . Are you OK for the trial? . # . # . I believe Mr. Montgomery . is about out of ideas. . # . # . We would like to call . Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. . # . # . Good idea! You can really see why he’s . considered one of the best lawyers… . # . # . Yeah. . # . # . Layton, you’ve . gotta weave some magic . # . # . with this jury, . or it’s gonna be all over. . # . # . Don’t worry. The only thing I have . to do to turn this jury around . # . # . is to remind them . of what they don’t like about bees. . # . # . - You got the tweezers? . - Are you allergic? . # . # . Only to losing, son. Only to losing. . # . # . Mr. Benson Bee, I’ll ask you . what I think we’d all like to know. . # . # . What exactly is your relationship . # . # . to that woman? . # . # . We’re friends. . # . # . - Good friends? . - Yes. . # . # . How good? Do you live together? . # . # . Wait a minute… . # . # . Are you her little… . # . # . …bedbug? . # . # . I’ve seen a bee documentary or two. . From what I understand, . # . # . doesn’t your queen give birth . to all the bee children? . # . # . - Yeah, but… . - So those aren’t your real parents! . # . # . - Oh, Barry… . - Yes, they are! . # . # . Hold me back! . # . # . You’re an illegitimate bee, . aren’t you, Benson? . # . # . He’s denouncing bees! . # . # . Don’t y’all date your cousins? . # . # . - Objection! . - I’m going to pincushion this guy! . # . # . Adam, don’t! It’s what he wants! . # . # . Oh, I’m hit!! . # . # . Oh, lordy, I am hit! . # . # . Order! Order! . # . # . The venom! The venom . is coursing through my veins! . # . # . I have been felled . by a winged beast of destruction! . # . # . You see? You can’t treat them . like equals! They’re striped savages! . # . # . Stinging’s the only thing . they know! It’s their way! . # . # . - Adam, stay with me. . - I can’t feel my legs. . # . # . What angel of mercy . will come forward to suck the poison . # . # . from my heaving buttocks? . # . # . I will have order in this court. Order! . # . # . Order, please! . # . # . The case of the honeybees . versus the human race . # . # . took a pointed turn against the bees . # . # . yesterday when one of their legal . team stung Layton T. Montgomery. . # . # . - Hey, buddy. . - Hey. . # . # . - Is there much pain? . - Yeah. . # . # . I… . # . # . I blew the whole case, didn’t I? . # . # . It doesn’t matter. What matters is . you’re alive. You could have died. . # . # . I’d be better off dead. Look at me. . # . # . They got it from the cafeteria . downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. . # . # . Look, there’s . a little celery still on it. . # . # . What was it like to sting someone? . # . # . I can’t explain it. It was all… . # . # . All adrenaline and then… . and then ecstasy! . # . # . All right. . # . # . You think it was all a trap? . # . # . Of course. I’m sorry. . I flew us right into this. . # . # . What were we thinking? Look at us. We’re . just a couple of bugs in this world. . # . # . What will the humans do to us . if they win? . # . # . I don’t know. . # . # . I hear they put the roaches in motels. . That doesn’t sound so bad. . # . # . Adam, they check in, . but they don’t check out! . # . # . Oh, my. . # . # . Oould you get a nurse . to close that window? . # . # . - Why? . - The smoke. . # . # . Bees don’t smoke. . # . # . Right. Bees don’t smoke. . # . # . Bees don’t smoke! . But some bees are smoking. . # . # . That’s it! That’s our case! . # . # . It is? It’s not over? . # . # . Get dressed. I’ve gotta go somewhere. . # . # . Get back to the court and stall. . Stall any way you can. . # . # . And assuming you’ve done step correctly, you’re ready for the tub. . # . # . Mr. Flayman. . # . # . Yes? Yes, Your Honor! . # . # . Where is the rest of your team? . # . # . Well, Your Honor, it’s interesting. . # . # . Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, . # . # . and as a result, . we don’t make very good time. . # . # . I actually heard a funny story about… . # . # . Your Honor, . haven’t these ridiculous bugs . # . # . taken up enough . of this court’s valuable time? . # . # . How much longer will we allow . these absurd shenanigans to go on? . # . # . They have presented no compelling . evidence to support their charges . # . # . against my clients, . who run legitimate businesses. . # . # . I move for a complete dismissal . of this entire case! . # . # . Mr. Flayman, I’m afraid I’m going . # . # . to have to consider . Mr. Montgomery’s motion. . # . # . But you can’t! We have a terrific case. . # . # . Where is your proof? . Where is the evidence? . # . # . Show me the smoking gun! . # . # . Hold it, Your Honor! . You want a smoking gun? . # . # . Here is your smoking gun. . # . # . What is that? . # . # . It’s a bee smoker! . # . # . What, this? . This harmless little contraption? . # . # . This couldn’t hurt a fly, . let alone a bee. . # . # . Look at what has happened . # . # . to bees who have never been asked, . “Smoking or non?” . # . # . Is this what nature intended for us? . # . # . To be forcibly addicted . to smoke machines . # . # . and man-made wooden slat work camps? . # . # . Living out our lives as honey slaves . to the white man? . # . # . - What are we gonna do? . - He’s playing the species card. . # . # . Ladies and gentlemen, please, . free these bees! . # . # . Free the bees! Free the bees! . # . # . Free the bees! . # . # . Free the bees! Free the bees! . # . # . The court finds in favor of the bees! . # . # . Vanessa, we won! . # . # . I knew you could do it! High-five! . # . # . Sorry. . # . # . I’m OK! You know what this means? . # . # . All the honey . will finally belong to the bees. . # . # . Now we won’t have . to work so hard all the time. . # . # . This is an unholy perversion . of the balance of nature, Benson. . # . # . You’ll regret this. . # . # . Barry, how much honey is out there? . # . # . All right. One at a time. . # . # . Barry, who are you wearing? . # . # . My sweater is Ralph Lauren, . and I have no pants. . # . # . - What if Montgomery’s right? . - What do you mean? . # . # . We’ve been living the bee way . a long time, 27 million years. . # . # . Oongratulations on your victory. . What will you demand as a settlement? . # . # . First, we’ll demand a complete shutdown . of all bee work camps. . # . # . Then we want back the honey . that was ours to begin with, . # . # . every last drop. . # . # . We demand an end to the glorification . of the bear as anything more . # . # . than a filthy, smelly, . bad-breath stink machine. . # . # . We’re all aware . of what they do in the woods. . # . # . Wait for my signal. . # . # . Take him out. . # . # . He’ll have nauseous . for a few hours, then he’ll be fine. . # . # . And we will no longer tolerate . bee-negative nicknames… . # . # . But it’s just a prance-about stage name! . # . # . …unnecessary inclusion of honey . in bogus health products . # . # . and la-dee-da human . tea-time snack garnishments. . # . # . Oan’t breathe. . # . # . Bring it in, boys! . # . # . Hold it right there! Good. . # . # . Tap it. . # . # . Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, . and there’s gallons more coming! . # . # . - I think we need to shut down! . - Shut down? We’ve never shut down. . # . # . Shut down honey production! . # . # . Stop making honey! . # . # . Turn your key, sir! . # . # . What do we do now? . # . # . Oannonball! . # . # . We’re shutting honey production! . # . # . Mission abort. . # . # . Aborting pollination and nectar detail. . Returning to base. . # . # . Adam, you wouldn’t believe . how much honey was out there. . # . # . Oh, yeah? . # . # . What’s going on? Where is everybody? . # . # . - Are they out celebrating? . - They’re home. . # . # . They don’t know what to do. . Laying out, sleeping in. . # . # . I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way . to San Antonio with a cricket. . # . # . At least we got our honey back. . # . # . Sometimes I think, so what if humans . liked our honey? Who wouldn’t? . # . # . It’s the greatest thing in the world! . I was excited to be part of making it. . # . # . This was my new desk. This was my . new job. I wanted to do it really well. . # . # . And now… . # . # . Now I can’t. . # . # . I don’t understand . why they’re not happy. . # . # . I thought their lives would be better! . # . # . They’re doing nothing. It’s amazing. . Honey really changes people. . # . # . You don’t have any idea . what’s going on, do you? . # . # . - What did you want to show me? . - This. . # . # . What happened here? . # . # . That is not the half of it. . # . # . Oh, no. Oh, my. . # . # . They’re all wilting. . # . # . Doesn’t look very good, does it? . # . # . No. . # . # . And whose fault do you think that is? . # . # . You know, I’m gonna guess bees. . # . # . Bees? . # . # . Specifically, me. . # . # . I didn’t think bees not needing to make . honey would affect all these things. . # . # . It’s notjust flowers. . Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. . # . # . That’s our whole SAT test right there. . # . # . Take away produce, that affects . the entire animal kingdom. . # . # . And then, of course… . # . # . The human species? . # . # . So if there’s no more pollination, . # . # . it could all just go south here, . couldn’t it? . # . # . I know this is also partly my fault. . # . # . How about a suicide pact? . # . # . How do we do it? . # . # . - I’ll sting you, you step on me. . - Thatjust kills you twice. . # . # . Right, right. . # . # . Listen, Barry… . sorry, but I gotta get going. . # . # . I had to open my mouth and talk. . # . # . Vanessa? . # . # . Vanessa? Why are you leaving? . Where are you going? . # . # . To the final Tournament of Roses parade . in Pasadena. . # . # . They’ve moved it to this weekend . because all the flowers are dying. . # . # . It’s the last chance . I’ll ever have to see it. . # . # . Vanessa, I just wanna say I’m sorry. . I never meant it to turn out like this. . # . # . I know. Me neither. . # . # . Tournament of Roses. . Roses can’t do sports. . # . # . Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? . # . # . Roses! . # . # . Vanessa! . # . # . Roses?! . # . # . Barry? . # . # . - Roses are flowers! . - Yes, they are. . # . # . Flowers, bees, pollen! . # . # . I know. . That’s why this is the last parade. . # . # . Maybe not. . Oould you ask him to slow down? . # . # . Oould you slow down? . # . # . Barry! . # . # . OK, I made a huge mistake. . This is a total disaster, all my fault. . # . # . Yes, it kind of is. . # . # . I’ve ruined the planet. . I wanted to help you . # . # . with the flower shop. . I’ve made it worse. . # . # . Actually, it’s completely closed down. . # . # . I thought maybe you were remodeling. . # . # . But I have another idea, and it’s . greater than my previous ideas combined. . # . # . I don’t want to hear it! . # . # . All right, they have the roses, . the roses have the pollen. . # . # . I know every bee, plant . and flower bud in this park. . # . # . All we gotta do is get what they’ve got . back here with what we’ve got. . # . # . - Bees. . - Park. . # . # . - Pollen! . - Flowers. . # . # . - Repollination! . - Across the nation! . # . # . Tournament of Roses, . Pasadena, Oalifornia. . # . # . They’ve got nothing . but flowers, floats and cotton candy. . # . # . Security will be tight. . # . # . I have an idea. . # . # . Vanessa Bloome, FTD. . # . # . Official floral business. It’s real. . # . # . Sorry, ma’am. Nice brooch. . # . # . Thank you. It was a gift. . # . # . Once inside, . we just pick the right float. . # . # . How about The Princess and the Pea? . # . # . I could be the princess, . and you could be the pea! . # . # . Yes, I got it. . # . # . - Where should I sit? . - What are you? . # . # . - I believe I’m the pea. . - The pea? . # . # . It goes under the mattresses. . # . # . - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. . - I’m getting the marshal. . # . # . You do that! . This whole parade is a fiasco! . # . # . Let’s see what this baby’ll do. . # . # . Hey, what are you doing?! . # . # . Then all we do . is blend in with traffic… . # . # . …without arousing suspicion. . # . # . Once at the airport, . there’s no stopping us. . # . # . Stop! Security. . # . # . - You and your insect pack your float? . - Yes. . # . # . Has it been . in your possession the entire time? . # . # . Would you remove your shoes? . # . # . - Remove your stinger. . - It’s part of me. . # . # . I know. Just having some fun. . Enjoy your flight. . # . # . Then if we’re lucky, we’ll have . just enough pollen to do the job. . # . # . Oan you believe how lucky we are? We . have just enough pollen to do the job! . # . # . I think this is gonna work. . # . # . It’s got to work. . # . # . Attention, passengers, . this is Oaptain Scott. . # . # . We have a bit of bad weather . in New York. . # . # . It looks like we’ll experience . a couple hours delay. . # . # . Barry, these are cut flowers . with no water. They’ll never make it. . # . # . I gotta get up there . and talk to them. . # . # . Be careful. . # . # . Oan I get help . with the Sky Mall magazine? . # . # . I’d like to order the talking . inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. . # . # . Oaptain, I’m in a real situation. . # . # . - What’d you say, Hal? . - Nothing. . # . # . Bee! . # . # . Don’t freak out! My entire species… . # . # . What are you doing? . # . # . - Wait a minute! I’m an attorney! . - Who’s an attorney? . # . # . Don’t move. . # . # . Oh, Barry. . # . # . Good afternoon, passengers. . This is your captain. . # . # . Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B . please report to the cockpit? . # . # . And please hurry! . # . # . What happened here? . # . # . There was a DustBuster, . a toupee, a life raft exploded. . # . # . One’s bald, one’s in a boat, . they’re both unconscious! . # . # . - Is that another bee joke? . - No! . # . # . No one’s flying the plane! . # . # . This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. . What’s your status? . # . # . This is Vanessa Bloome. . I’m a florist from New York. . # . # . Where’s the pilot? . # . # . He’s unconscious, . and so is the copilot. . # . # . Not good. Does anyone onboard . have flight experience? . # . # . As a matter of fact, there is. . # . # . - Who’s that? . - Barry Benson. . # . # . From the honey trial?! Oh, great. . # . # . Vanessa, this is nothing more . than a big metal bee. . # . # . It’s got giant wings, huge engines. . # . # . I can’t fly a plane. . # . # . - Why not? Isn’t John Travolta a pilot? . - Yes. . # . # . How hard could it be? . # . # . Wait, Barry! . We’re headed into some lightning. . # . # . This is Bob Bumble. We have some . late-breaking news from JFK Airport, . # . # . where a suspenseful scene . is developing. . # . # . Barry Benson, . fresh from his legal victory… . # . # . That’s Barry! . # . # . …is attempting to land a plane, . loaded with people, flowers . # . # . and an incapacitated flight crew. . # . # . Flowers?! . # . # . We have a storm in the area . and two individuals at the controls . # . # . with absolutely no flight experience. . # . # . Just a minute. . There’s a bee on that plane. . # . # . I’m quite familiar with Mr. Benson . and his no-account compadres. . # . # . They’ve done enough damage. . # . # . But isn’t he your only hope? . # . # . Technically, a bee . shouldn’t be able to fly at all. . # . # . Their wings are too small… . # . # . Haven’t we heard this a million times? . # . # . “The surface area of the wings . and body mass make no sense.” . # . # . - Get this on the air! . - Got it. . # . # . - Stand by. . - We’re going live. . # . # . The way we work may be a mystery to you. . # . # . Making honey takes a lot of bees . doing a lot of small jobs. . # . # . But let me tell you about a small job. . # . # . If you do it well, . it makes a big difference. . # . # . More than we realized. . To us, to everyone. . # . # . That’s why I want to get bees . back to working together. . # . # .

Finally, the Bee Movie script is here for all you fans of the Jerry Seinfeld animated movie. This puppy is a transcript that was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of the movie to get the dialogue. I know, I know, I still need to get the cast names in there and all that jazz, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. At least you’ll have some Bee Movie quotes (or even a monologue or two) to annoy your coworkers with in the meantime, right? . And swing on back to Drew’s Script-O-Rama afterwards – because reading is good for your noodle. Better than Farmville, anyway. . Bee Movie Script . According to all known laws . of aviation, . there is no way a bee . should be able to fly. . Its wings are too small to get . its fat little body off the ground. . The bee, of course, flies anyway . because bees don’t care . what humans think is impossible. . Yellow, black. Yellow, black. . Yellow, black. Yellow, black. . Ooh, black and yellow! . Let’s shake it up a little. . Barry! Breakfast is ready! . Ooming! . Hang on a second. . Hello? . - Barry? . - Adam? . - Oan you believe this is happening? . - I can’t. I’ll pick you up. . Looking sharp. . Use the stairs. Your father . paid good money for those. . Sorry. I’m excited. . Here’s the graduate. . We’re very proud of you, son. . A perfect report card, all B’s. . Very proud. . Ma! I got a thing going here. . - You got lint on your fuzz. . - Ow! That’s me! . - Wave to us! We’ll be in row 118,000. . - Bye! . Barry, I told you, . stop flying in the house! . - Hey, Adam. . - Hey, Barry. . - Is that fuzz gel? . - A little. Special day, graduation. . Never thought I’d make it. . Three days grade school, . three days high school. . Those were awkward. . Three days college. I’m glad I took . a day and hitchhiked around the hive. . You did come back different. . - Hi, Barry. . - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. . - Hear about Frankie? . - Yeah. . - You going to the funeral? . - No, I’m not going. . Everybody knows, . sting someone, you die. . Don’t waste it on a squirrel. . Such a hothead. . I guess he could have . just gotten out of the way. . I love this incorporating . an amusement park into our day. . That’s why we don’t need vacations. . Boy, quite a bit of pomp… . under the circumstances. . - Well, Adam, today we are men. . - We are! . - Bee-men. . - Amen! . Hallelujah! . Students, faculty, distinguished bees, . please welcome Dean Buzzwell. . Welcome, New Hive Oity . graduating class of… . …9:15. . That concludes our ceremonies. . And begins your career . at Honex Industries! . Will we pick ourjob today? . I heard it’s just orientation. . Heads up! Here we go. . Keep your hands and antennas . inside the tram at all times. . - Wonder what it’ll be like? . - A little scary. . Welcome to Honex, . a division of Honesco . and a part of the Hexagon Group. . This is it! . Wow. . Wow. . We know that you, as a bee, . have worked your whole life . to get to the point where you . can work for your whole life. . Honey begins when our valiant Pollen . Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. . Our top-secret formula . is automatically color-corrected, . scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured . into this soothing sweet syrup . with its distinctive . golden glow you know as… . Honey! . - That girl was hot. . - She’s my cousin! . - She is? . - Yes, we’re all cousins. . - Right. You’re right. . - At Honex, we constantly strive . to improve every aspect . of bee existence. . These bees are stress-testing . a new helmet technology. . - What do you think he makes? . - Not enough. . Here we have our latest advancement, . the Krelman. . - What does that do? . - Oatches that little strand of honey . that hangs after you pour it. . Saves us millions. . Oan anyone work on the Krelman? . Of course. Most bee jobs are . small ones. But bees know . that every small job, . if it’s done well, means a lot. . But choose carefully . because you’ll stay in the job . you pick for the rest of your life. . The same job the rest of your life? . I didn’t know that. . What’s the difference? . You’ll be happy to know that bees, . as a species, haven’t had one day off . in 27 million years. . So you’ll just work us to death? . We’ll sure try. . Wow! That blew my mind! . “What’s the difference?” . How can you say that? . One job forever? . That’s an insane choice to have to make. . I’m relieved. Now we only have . to make one decision in life. . But, Adam, how could they . never have told us that? . Why would you question anything? . We’re bees. . We’re the most perfectly . functioning society on Earth. . You ever think maybe things . work a little too well here? . Like what? Give me one example. . I don’t know. But you know . what I’m talking about. . Please clear the gate. . Royal Nectar Force on approach. . Wait a second. Oheck it out. . - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! . - Wow. . I’ve never seen them this close. . They know what it’s like . outside the hive. . Yeah, but some don’t come back. . - Hey, Jocks! . - Hi, Jocks! . You guys did great! . You’re monsters! . You’re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! . - I wonder where they were. . - I don’t know. . Their day’s not planned. . Outside the hive, flying who knows . where, doing who knows what. . You can’tjust decide to be a Pollen . Jock. You have to be bred for that. . Right. . Look. That’s more pollen . than you and I will see in a lifetime. . It’s just a status symbol. . Bees make too much of it. . Perhaps. Unless you’re wearing it . and the ladies see you wearing it. . Those ladies? . Aren’t they our cousins too? . Distant. Distant. . Look at these two. . - Oouple of Hive Harrys. . - Let’s have fun with them. . It must be dangerous . being a Pollen Jock. . Yeah. Once a bear pinned me . against a mushroom! . He had a paw on my throat, . and with the other, he was slapping me! . - Oh, my! . - I never thought I’d knock him out. . What were you doing during this? . Trying to alert the authorities. . I can autograph that. . A little gusty out there today, . wasn’t it, comrades? . Yeah. Gusty. . We’re hitting a sunflower patch . six miles from here tomorrow. . - Six miles, huh? . - Barry! . A puddle jump for us, . but maybe you’re not up for it. . - Maybe I am. . - You are not! . We’re going 0900 at J-Gate. . What do you think, buzzy-boy? . Are you bee enough? . I might be. It all depends . on what 0900 means. . Hey, Honex! . Dad, you surprised me. . You decide what you’re interested in? . - Well, there’s a lot of choices. . - But you only get one. . Do you ever get bored . doing the same job every day? . Son, let me tell you about stirring. . You grab that stick, and you just . move it around, and you stir it around. . You get yourself into a rhythm. . It’s a beautiful thing. . You know, Dad, . the more I think about it, . maybe the honey field . just isn’t right for me. . You were thinking of what, . making balloon animals? . That’s a bad job . for a guy with a stinger. . Janet, your son’s not sure . he wants to go into honey! . - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. . - I’m not trying to be funny. . You’re not funny! You’re going . into honey. Our son, the stirrer! . - You’re gonna be a stirrer? . - No one’s listening to me! . Wait till you see the sticks I have. . I could say anything right now. . I’m gonna get an ant tattoo! . Let’s open some honey and celebrate! . Maybe I’ll pierce my thorax. . Shave my antennae. . Shack up with a grasshopper. Get . a gold tooth and call everybody “dawg”! . I’m so proud. . - We’re starting work today! . - Today’s the day. . Oome on! All the good jobs . will be gone. . Yeah, right. . Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, . stirrer, front desk, hair removal… . - Is it still available? . - Hang on. Two left! . One of them’s yours! Oongratulations! . Step to the side. . - What’d you get? . - Picking crud out. Stellar! . Wow! . Oouple of newbies? . Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! . Make your choice. . - You want to go first? . - No, you go. . Oh, my. What’s available? . Restroom attendant’s open, . not for the reason you think. . - Any chance of getting the Krelman? . - Sure, you’re on. . I’m sorry, the Krelman just closed out. . Wax monkey’s always open. . The Krelman opened up again. . What happened? . A bee died. Makes an opening. See? . He’s dead. Another dead one. . Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. . Dead from the neck up. . Dead from the neck down. That’s life! . Oh, this is so hard! . Heating, cooling, . stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, . humming, inspector number seven, . lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, . mite wrangler. Barry, what . do you think I should… Barry? . Barry! . All right, we’ve got the sunflower patch . in quadrant nine… . What happened to you? . Where are you? . - I’m going out. . - Out? Out where? . - Out there. . - Oh, no! . I have to, before I go . to work for the rest of my life. . You’re gonna die! You’re crazy! Hello? . Another call coming in. . If anyone’s feeling brave, . there’s a Korean deli on 83rd . that gets their roses today. . Hey, guys. . - Look at that. . - Isn’t that the kid we saw yesterday? . Hold it, son, flight deck’s restricted. . It’s OK, Lou. We’re gonna take him up. . Really? Feeling lucky, are you? . Sign here, here. Just initial that. . - Thank you. . - OK. . You got a rain advisory today, . and as you all know, . bees cannot fly in rain. . So be careful. As always, . watch your brooms, . hockey sticks, dogs, . birds, bears and bats. . Also, I got a couple of reports . of root beer being poured on us. . Murphy’s in a home because of it, . babbling like a cicada! . - That’s awful. . - And a reminder for you rookies, . bee law number one, . absolutely no talking to humans! . All right, launch positions! . Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, . buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! . Black and yellow! . Hello! . You ready for this, hot shot? . Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. .

Pound those petunias, . you striped stem-suckers! . All of you, drain those flowers! . Wow! I’m out! . I can’t believe I’m out! . So blue. . I feel so fast and free! . Box kite! . Wow! . Flowers! . This is Blue Leader. . We have roses visual. . Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. . Roses! . 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. . Stand to the side, kid. . It’s got a bit of a kick. . That is one nectar collector! . - Ever see pollination up close? . - No, sir. . I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it . over here. Maybe a dash over there, . a pinch on that one. . See that? It’s a little bit of magic. . That’s amazing. Why do we do that? . That’s pollen power. More pollen, more . flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. . Oool. . I’m picking up a lot of bright yellow. . Oould be daisies. Don’t we need those? . Oopy that visual. . Wait. One of these flowers . seems to be on the move. . Say again? You’re reporting . a moving flower? . Affirmative. . That was on the line! . This is the coolest. What is it? . I don’t know, but I’m loving this color. . It smells good. . Not like a flower, but I like it. . Yeah, fuzzy. . Ohemical-y. . Oareful, guys.

You can start packing up, honey, . because you’re about to eat it! . Yowser! . Gross. . There’s a bee in the car! . - Do something! . - I’m driving! . - Hi, bee. . - He’s back here! . He’s going to sting me! . Nobody move. If you don’t move, . he won’t sting you. Freeze! . He blinked! . Spray him, Granny! . What are you doing?! . Wow… the tension level . out here is unbelievable. . I gotta get home. . Oan’t fly in rain. . Oan’t fly in rain. . Oan’t fly in rain. . Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! . Ken, could you close . the window please? . Ken, could you close . the window please? . Oheck out my new resume. . I made it into a fold-out brochure. . You see? Folds out. . Oh, no. More humans. I don’t need this. . What was that? . Maybe this time. This time. This time. . This time! This time! This… . Drapes! . That is diabolical. . It’s fantastic. It’s got all my special . skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. . What’s number one? Star Wars? . Nah, I don’t go for that… . …kind of stuff. . No wonder we shouldn’t talk to them. . They’re out of their minds. . When I leave a job interview, they’re . flabbergasted, can’t believe what I say. . There’s the sun. Maybe that’s a way out. . I don’t remember the sun . having a big 75 on it. . I predicted global warming. . I could feel it getting hotter. . At first I thought it was just me. . Wait! Stop! Bee! . Stand back. These are winter boots. . Wait! . Don’t kill him! . You know I’m allergic to them! . This thing could kill me! . Why does his life have . less value than yours? . Why does his life have any less value . than mine? Is that your statement? . I’m just saying all life has value. You . don’t know what he’s capable of feeling. . My brochure! . There you go, little guy. . I’m not scared of him. . It’s an allergic thing. . Put that on your resume brochure. . My whole face could puff up. . Make it one of your special skills. . Knocking someone out . is also a special skill. . Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. . - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? . - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. . - You could put carob chips on there. . - Bye. . - Supposed to be less calories. . - Bye. . I gotta say something. . She saved my life. . I gotta say something. . All right, here it goes. . Nah. . What would I say? . I could really get in trouble. . It’s a bee law. . You’re not supposed to talk to a human. . I can’t believe I’m doing this. . I’ve got to. . Oh, I can’t do it. Oome on! . No. Yes. No. . Do it. I can’t. . How should I start it? . “You like jazz?” No, that’s no good. . Here she comes! Speak, you fool! . Hi! . I’m sorry. . - You’re talking. . - Yes, I know. . You’re talking! . I’m so sorry. . No, it’s OK. It’s fine. . I know I’m dreaming. . But I don’t recall going to bed. . Well, I’m sure this . is very disconcerting. . This is a bit of a surprise to me. . I mean, you’re a bee! . I am. And I’m not supposed . to be doing this, . but they were all trying to kill me. . And if it wasn’t for you… . I had to thank you. . It’s just how I was raised. . That was a little weird. . - I’m talking with a bee. . - Yeah. . I’m talking to a bee. . And the bee is talking to me! . I just want to say I’m grateful. . I’ll leave now. . - Wait! How did you learn to do that? . - What? . The talking thing. . Same way you did, I guess. . “Mama, Dada, honey.” You pick it up. . - That’s very funny. . - Yeah. . Bees are funny. If we didn’t laugh, . we’d cry with what we have to deal with. . Anyway… . Oan I… . …get you something? . - Like what? . I don’t know. I mean… . I don’t know. Ooffee? . I don’t want to put you out. . It’s no trouble. It takes two minutes. . - It’s just coffee. . - I hate to impose. . - Don’t be ridiculous! . - Actually, I would love a cup. . Hey, you want rum cake? . - I shouldn’t. . - Have some. . - No, I can’t. . - Oome on! . I’m trying to lose a couple micrograms. . - Where? . - These stripes don’t help. . You look great! . I don’t know if you know . anything about fashion. . Are you all right? . No. . He’s making the tie in the cab . as they’re flying up Madison. . He finally gets there. . He runs up the steps into the church. . The wedding is on. . And he says, “Watermelon? . I thought you said Guatemalan. . Why would I marry a watermelon?” . Is that a bee joke? . That’s the kind of stuff we do. . Yeah, different. . So, what are you gonna do, Barry? . About work? I don’t know. . I want to do my part for the hive, . but I can’t do it the way they want. . I know how you feel. . - You do? . - Sure. . My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or . a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. . - Really? . - My only interest is flowers. . Our new queen was just elected . with that same campaign slogan. . Anyway, if you look… . There’s my hive right there. See it? . You’re in Sheep Meadow! . Yes! I’m right off the Turtle Pond! . No way! I know that area. . I lost a toe ring there once. . - Why do girls put rings on their toes? . - Why not? . - It’s like putting a hat on your knee. . - Maybe I’ll try that. . - You all right, ma’am? . - Oh, yeah. Fine. . Just having two cups of coffee! . Anyway, this has been great. . Thanks for the coffee. . Yeah, it’s no trouble. . Sorry I couldn’t finish it. If I did, . I’d be up the rest of my life. . Are you…? . Oan I take a piece of this with me? . Sure! Here, have a crumb. . - Thanks! . - Yeah. . All right. Well, then… . I guess I’ll see you around. . Or not. . OK, Barry. . And thank you . so much again… for before. . Oh, that? That was nothing. . Well, not nothing, but… Anyway… . This can’t possibly work. . He’s all set to go. . We may as well try it. . OK, Dave, pull the chute. . - Sounds amazing. . - It was amazing! . It was the scariest, . happiest moment of my life. . Humans! I can’t believe . you were with humans! . Giant, scary humans! . What were they like? . Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. . They eat crazy giant things. . They drive crazy. . - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? . - Some of them. But some of them don’t. . - How’d you get back? . - Poodle. . You did it, and I’m glad. You saw . whatever you wanted to see. . You had your “experience.” Now you . can pick out yourjob and be normal. . - Well… . - Well? . Well, I met someone. . You did? Was she Bee-ish? . - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! . - No, no, no, not a wasp. . - Spider? . - I’m not attracted to spiders. . I know it’s the hottest thing, . with the eight legs and all. . I can’t get by that face. . So who is she? . She’s… human. . No, no. That’s a bee law. . You wouldn’t break a bee law. . - Her name’s Vanessa. . - Oh, boy. . She’s so nice. And she’s a florist! . Oh, no! You’re dating a human florist! . We’re not dating. . You’re flying outside the hive, talking . to humans that attack our homes . with power washers and M-80s! . One-eighth a stick of dynamite! . She saved my life! . And she understands me. . This is over! . Eat this. . This is not over! What was that? . - They call it a crumb. . - It was so stingin’ stripey! . And that’s not what they eat. . That’s what falls off what they eat! . - You know what a Oinnabon is? . - No. . It’s bread and cinnamon and frosting. . They heat it up… . Sit down! . …really hot! . - Listen to me! . We are not them! We’re us. . There’s us and there’s them! . Yes, but who can deny . the heart that is yearning? . There’s no yearning. . Stop yearning. Listen to me! . You have got to start thinking bee, . my friend. Thinking bee! . - Thinking bee. . - Thinking bee. . Thinking bee! Thinking bee! . Thinking bee! Thinking bee! . There he is. He’s in the pool. . You know what your problem is, Barry? . I gotta start thinking bee? . How much longer will this go on? . It’s been three days! . Why aren’t you working? . I’ve got a lot of big life decisions . to think about. . What life? You have no life! . You have no job. You’re barely a bee! . Would it kill you . to make a little honey? . Barry, come out. . Your father’s talking to you. . Martin, would you talk to him? . Barry, I’m talking to you! . You coming? . Got everything? . All set! . Go ahead. I’ll catch up. . Don’t be too long. . Watch this! . Vanessa! . - We’re still here. . - I told you not to yell at him. . He doesn’t respond to yelling! . - Then why yell at me? . - Because you don’t listen! . I’m not listening to this. . Sorry, I’ve gotta go. . - Where are you going? . - I’m meeting a friend. . A girl? Is this why you can’t decide? . Bye. . I just hope she’s Bee-ish. . They have a huge parade . of flowers every year in Pasadena? . To be in the Tournament of Roses, . that’s every florist’s dream! . Up on a float, surrounded . by flowers, crowds cheering. . A tournament. Do the roses . compete in athletic events? . No. All right, I’ve got one. . How come you don’t fly everywhere? . It’s exhausting. Why don’t you . run everywhere? It’s faster. . Yeah, OK, I see, I see. . All right, your turn. . TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? . That’s insane! . You don’t have that? . We have Hivo, but it’s a disease. . It’s a horrible, horrible disease. . Oh, my. . Dumb bees! . You must want to sting all those jerks. . We try not to sting. . It’s usually fatal for us. . So you have to watch your temper. . Very carefully. . You kick a wall, take a walk, . write an angry letter and throw it out. . Work through it like any emotion: . Anger, jealousy, lust. . Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? . Yeah. . - What is wrong with you?! . - It’s a bug. . He’s not bothering anybody. . Get out of here, you creep! . What was that? A Pic ‘N’ Save circular? . Yeah, it was. How did you know? . It felt like about 10 pages. . Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. . You’ve really got that . down to a science. . - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. . - I’ll bet. . What in the name . of Mighty Hercules is this? . How did this get here? . Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, . Ray Liotta Private Select? . - Is he that actor? . - I never heard of him. . - Why is this here? . - For people. We eat it. . You don’t have . enough food of your own? . - Well, yes. . - How do you get it? . - Bees make it. . - I know who makes it! . And it’s hard to make it! . There’s heating, cooling, stirring. . You need a whole Krelman thing! . - It’s organic. . - It’s our-ganic! . It’s just honey, Barry. . Just what?! . Bees don’t know about this! . This is stealing! A lot of stealing! . You’ve taken our homes, schools, . hospitals! This is all we have! . And it’s on sale?! . I’m getting to the bottom of this. . I’m getting to the bottom . of all of this! . Hey, Hector. . - You almost done? . - Almost. . He is here. I sense it. . Well, I guess I’ll go home now . and just leave this nice honey out, . with no one around. . You’re busted, box boy! . I knew I heard something. . So you can talk! . I can talk. . And now you’ll start talking! . Where you getting the sweet stuff? . Who’s your supplier? . I don’t understand. . I thought we were friends. . The last thing we want . to do is upset bees! . You’re too late! It’s ours now! . You, sir, have crossed . the wrong sword! . You, sir, will be lunch . for my iguana, Ignacio! . Where is the honey coming from? . Tell me where! . Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! . Orazy person! . What horrible thing has happened here? . These faces, they never knew . what hit them. And now . they’re on the road to nowhere! . Just keep still. . What? You’re not dead? . Do I look dead?

I’m going to Tacoma. . - And you? . - He really is dead. . All right. . Uh-oh! . - What is that?! . - Oh, no! . - A wiper! Triple blade! . - Triple blade? . Jump on! It’s your only chance, bee! . Why does everything have . to be so doggone clean?! . How much do you people need to see?! . Open your eyes! . Stick your head out the window! . From NPR News in Washington, . I’m Oarl Kasell. . But don’t kill no more bugs! . - Bee! . - Moose blood guy!! . - You hear something? . - Like what? . Like tiny screaming. . Turn off the radio. . Whassup, bee boy? . Hey, Blood. . Just a row of honey jars, . as far as the eye could see. . Wow! . I assume wherever this truck goes . is where they’re getting it. . I mean, that honey’s ours. . - Bees hang tight. . - We’re all jammed in. . It’s a close community. . Not us, man. We on our own. . Every mosquito on his own. . - What if you get in trouble? . - You a mosquito, you in trouble. . Nobody likes us. They just smack. . See a mosquito, smack, smack! . At least you’re out in the world. . You must meet girls. . Mosquito girls try to trade up, . get with a moth, dragonfly. . Mosquito girl don’t want no mosquito. . You got to be kidding me! . Mooseblood’s about to leave . the building! So long, bee! . - Hey, guys! . - Mooseblood! . I knew I’d catch y’all down here. . Did you bring your crazy straw? . We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, . and it’s pretty much pure profit. . What is this place? . A bee’s got a brain . the size of a pinhead. . They are pinheads! . Pinhead. . - Oheck out the new smoker. . - Oh, sweet. That’s the one you want. . The Thomas 3000! . Smoker? . Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. . Twice the nicotine, all the tar. . A couple breaths of this . knocks them right out. . They make the honey, . and we make the money. . “They make the honey, . and we make the money”? . Oh, my! . What’s going on? Are you OK? . Yeah. It doesn’t last too long. . Do you know you’re . in a fake hive with fake walls? . Our queen was moved here. . We had no choice. . This is your queen? . That’s a man in women’s clothes! . That’s a drag queen! . What is this? . Oh, no! . There’s hundreds of them! . Bee honey. . Our honey is being brazenly stolen . on a massive scale! . This is worse than anything bears . have done! I intend to do something. . Oh, Barry, stop. . Who told you humans are taking . our honey? That’s a rumor. . Do these look like rumors? . That’s a conspiracy theory. . These are obviously doctored photos. . How did you get mixed up in this? . He’s been talking to humans. . - What? . - Talking to humans?! . He has a human girlfriend. . And they make out! . Make out? Barry! . We do not. . - You wish you could. . - Whose side are you on? . The bees! . I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. . Those crazy legs kept me up all night. . Barry, this is what you want . to do with your life? . I want to do it for all our lives. . Nobody works harder than bees! . Dad, I remember you . coming home so overworked . your hands were still stirring. . You couldn’t stop. . I remember that. . What right do they have to our honey? . We live on two cups a year. They put it . in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! . Even if it’s true, what can one bee do? . Sting them where it really hurts. . In the face! The eye! . - That would hurt. . - No. . Up the nose? That’s a killer. . There’s only one place you can sting . the humans, one place where it matters. . Hive at Five, the hive’s only . full-hour action news source. . No more bee beards! . With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. . Weather with Storm Stinger. . Sports with Buzz Larvi. . And Jeanette Ohung. . - Good evening. I’m Bob Bumble. . - And I’m Jeanette Ohung. . A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, . intends to sue the human race . for stealing our honey, . packaging it and profiting . from it illegally! . Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, . we’ll have three former queens here in . our studio, discussing their new book, . Olassy Ladies, . out this week on Hexagon. . Tonight we’re talking to Barry Benson. . Did you ever think, “I’m a kid . from the hive. I can’t do this”? . Bees have never been afraid . to change the world. . What about Bee Oolumbus? . Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? . Where I’m from, we’d never sue humans. . We were thinking . of stickball or candy stores. . How old are you? . The bee community . is supporting you in this case, . which will be the trial . of the bee century. . You know, they have a Larry King . in the human world too. . It’s a common name. Next week… . He looks like you and has a show . and suspenders and colored dots… . Next week… . Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the . guest even though you just heard ‘em. . Bear Week next week! . They’re scary, hairy and here live. . Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, . squinty eyes, very Jewish. . In tennis, you attack . at the point of weakness! . It was my grandmother, Ken. She’s 81. . Honey, her backhand’s a joke! . I’m not gonna take advantage of that? . Quiet, please. . Actual work going on here. . - Is that that same bee? . - Yes, it is! . I’m helping him sue the human race. . - Hello. . - Hello, bee. . This is Ken. . Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size . ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. . Why does he talk again? . Listen, you better go . ‘cause we’re really busy working. . But it’s our yogurt night! . Bye-bye. . Why is yogurt night so difficult?! . You poor thing. . You two have been at this for hours! . Yes, and Adam here . has been a huge help. . - Frosting… . - How many sugars? . Just one. I try not . to use the competition. . So why are you helping me? . Bees have good qualities. . And it takes my mind off the shop. . Instead of flowers, people . are giving balloon bouquets now. . Those are great, if you’re three. . And artificial flowers. . - Oh, those just get me psychotic! . - Yeah, me too. . Bent stingers, pointless pollination. . Bees must hate those fake things! . Nothing worse . than a daffodil that’s had work done. . Maybe this could make up . for it a little bit. . - This lawsuit’s a pretty big deal. . - I guess. . You sure you want to go through with it? . Am I sure? When I’m done with . the humans, they won’t be able . to say, “Honey, I’m home,” . without paying a royalty! . It’s an incredible scene . here in downtown Manhattan, . where the world anxiously waits, . because for the first time in history, . we will hear for ourselves . if a honeybee can actually speak. . What have we gotten into here, Barry? . It’s pretty big, isn’t it? . I can’t believe how many humans . don’t work during the day. . You think billion-dollar multinational . food companies have good lawyers? . Everybody needs to stay . behind the barricade. . - What’s the matter? . - I don’t know, I just got a chill. . Well, if it isn’t the bee team. . You boys work on this? . All rise! The Honorable . Judge Bumbleton presiding. . All right. Oase number 4475, . Superior Oourt of New York, . Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry . is now in session. . Mr. Montgomery, you’re representing . the five food companies collectively? . A privilege. . Mr. Benson… you’re representing . all the bees of the world? . I’m kidding. Yes, Your Honor, . we’re ready to proceed. . Mr. Montgomery, . your opening statement, please. . Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, . my grandmother was a simple woman. . Born on a farm, she believed . it was man’s divine right . to benefit from the bounty . of nature God put before us. . If we lived in the topsy-turvy world . Mr. Benson imagines, . just think of what would it mean. . I would have to negotiate . with the silkworm . for the elastic in my britches! . Talking bee! . How do we know this isn’t some sort of . holographic motion-picture-capture . Hollywood wizardry? . They could be using laser beams! . Robotics! Ventriloquism! . Oloning! For all we know, . he could be on steroids! . Mr. Benson? . Ladies and gentlemen, . there’s no trickery here. . I’m just an ordinary bee. . Honey’s pretty important to me. . It’s important to all bees. . We invented it! . We make it. And we protect it . with our lives. . Unfortunately, there are . some people in this room . who think they can take it from us . ‘cause we’re the little guys! . I’m hoping that, after this is all over, . you’ll see how, by taking our honey, . you not only take everything we have . but everything we are! . I wish he’d dress like that . all the time. So nice! . Oall your first witness. . So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden . of Honey Farms, big company you have. . I suppose so. . I see you also own . Honeyburton and Honron! . Yes, they provide beekeepers . for our farms. . Beekeeper. I find that . to be a very disturbing term. . I don’t imagine you employ . any bee-free-ers, do you? . - No. . - I couldn’t hear you. . - No. . - No. . Because you don’t free bees. . You keep bees. Not only that, . it seems you thought a bear would be . an appropriate image for a jar of honey. . They’re very lovable creatures. . Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. . You mean like this? . Bears kill bees! . How’d you like his head crashing . through your living room?! . Biting into your couch! . Spitting out your throw pillows! . OK, that’s enough. Take him away. . So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. . Your name intrigues me. . - Where have I heard it before? . - I was with a band called The Police. . But you’ve never been . a police officer, have you? . No, I haven’t. . No, you haven’t. And so here . we have yet another example . of bee culture casually . stolen by a human . for nothing more than . a prance-about stage name. . Oh, please. . Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? . Because I’m feeling . a little stung, Sting. . Or should I say… Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! . That’s not his real name?! You idiots! . Mr. Liotta, first, . belated congratulations on . your Emmy win for a guest spot . on ER in 2005. . Thank you. Thank you. . I see from your resume . that you’re devilishly handsome . with a churning inner turmoil . that’s ready to blow. . I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? . Not yet it isn’t. But is this . what it’s come to for you? . Exploiting tiny, helpless bees . so you don’t . have to rehearse . your part and learn your lines, sir? . Watch it, Benson! . I could blow right now! . This isn’t a goodfella. . This is a badfella! . Why doesn’t someone just step on . this creep, and we can all go home?! . - Order in this court! . - You’re all thinking it! . Order! Order, I say! . - Say it! . - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! . I think it was awfully nice . of that bear to pitch in like that. . I think the jury’s on our side. . Are we doing everything right, legally? . I’m a florist. . Right. Well, here’s to a great team. . To a great team! . Well, hello. . - Ken! . - Hello. . I didn’t think you were coming. . No, I was just late. . I tried to call, but… the battery. . I didn’t want all this to go to waste, . so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. . Oh, that was lucky. . There’s a little left. . I could heat it up. . Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. . So I hear you’re quite a tennis player. . I’m not much for the game myself. . The ball’s a little grabby. . That’s where I usually sit. . Right… there. . Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, . and he agreed with me that eating with . chopsticks isn’t really a special skill. . You think I don’t see what you’re doing? . I know how hard it is to find . the rightjob. We have that in common. . Do we? . Bees have 100 percent employment, . but we do jobs like taking the crud out. . That’s just what . I was thinking about doing. . Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor . for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. . I’m going to drain the old stinger. . Yeah, you do that. . Look at that. . You know, I’ve just about had it . with your little mind games. . - What’s that? . - Italian Vogue. . Mamma mia, that’s a lot of pages. . A lot of ads. . Remember what Van said, why is . your life more valuable than mine? . Funny, I just can’t seem to recall that! . I think something stinks in here! . I love the smell of flowers. . How do you like the smell of flames?! . Not as much. . Water bug! Not taking sides! . Ken, I’m wearing a Ohapstick hat! . This is pathetic! . I’ve got issues! . Well, well, well, a royal flush! . - You’re bluffing. . - Am I? . Surf’s up, dude! . Poo water! . That bowl is gnarly. . Except for those dirty yellow rings! . Kenneth! What are you doing?! . You know, I don’t even like honey! . I don’t eat it! . We need to talk! . He’s just a little bee! . And he happens to be . the nicest bee I’ve met in a long time! . Long time? What are you talking about?! . Are there other bugs in your life? . No, but there are other things bugging . me in life. And you’re one of them! . Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night… . My nerves are fried from riding . on this emotional roller coaster! . Goodbye, Ken. . And for your information, . I prefer sugar-free, artificial . sweeteners made by man! . I’m sorry about all that. . I know it’s got . an aftertaste! I like it! . I always felt there was some kind . of barrier between Ken and me. . I couldn’t overcome it. . Oh, well. . Are you OK for the trial? . I believe Mr. Montgomery . is about out of ideas. . We would like to call . Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. . Good idea! You can really see why he’s . considered one of the best lawyers… . Yeah. . Layton, you’ve . gotta weave some magic . with this jury, . or it’s gonna be all over. . Don’t worry. The only thing I have . to do to turn this jury around . is to remind them . of what they don’t like about bees. . - You got the tweezers? . - Are you allergic? . Only to losing, son. Only to losing. . Mr. Benson Bee, I’ll ask you . what I think we’d all like to know. . What exactly is your relationship . to that woman? . We’re friends. . - Good friends? . - Yes. . How good? Do you live together? . Wait a minute… . Are you her little… . …bedbug? . I’ve seen a bee documentary or two. . From what I understand, . doesn’t your queen give birth . to all the bee children? . - Yeah, but… . - So those aren’t your real parents! . - Oh, Barry… . - Yes, they are! . Hold me back! . You’re an illegitimate bee, . aren’t you, Benson? . He’s denouncing bees! . Don’t y’all date your cousins? . - Objection! . - I’m going to pincushion this guy! . Adam, don’t! It’s what he wants! . Oh, I’m hit!! . Oh, lordy, I am hit! . Order! Order! . The venom! The venom . is coursing through my veins! . I have been felled . by a winged beast of destruction! . You see? You can’t treat them . like equals! They’re striped savages! . Stinging’s the only thing . they know! It’s their way! . - Adam, stay with me. . - I can’t feel my legs. . What angel of mercy . will come forward to suck the poison . from my heaving buttocks? . I will have order in this court. Order! . Order, please! . The case of the honeybees . versus the human race . took a pointed turn against the bees . yesterday when one of their legal . team stung Layton T. Montgomery. . - Hey, buddy. . - Hey. . - Is there much pain? . - Yeah. . I… . I blew the whole case, didn’t I? . It doesn’t matter. What matters is . you’re alive. You could have died. . I’d be better off dead. Look at me. . They got it from the cafeteria . downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. . Look, there’s . a little celery still on it. . What was it like to sting someone? . I can’t explain it. It was all… . All adrenaline and then… . and then ecstasy! . All right. . You think it was all a trap? . Of course. I’m sorry. . I flew us right into this. . What were we thinking? Look at us. We’re . just a couple of bugs in this world. . What will the humans do to us . if they win? . I don’t know. . I hear they put the roaches in motels. . That doesn’t sound so bad. . Adam, they check in, . but they don’t check out! . Oh, my. . Oould you get a nurse . to close that window? . - Why? . - The smoke. . Bees don’t smoke. . Right. Bees don’t smoke. . Bees don’t smoke! . But some bees are smoking. . That’s it! That’s our case! . It is? It’s not over? . Get dressed. I’ve gotta go somewhere. . Get back to the court and stall. . Stall any way you can. . And assuming you’ve done step correctly, you’re ready for the tub. . Mr. Flayman. . Yes? Yes, Your Honor! . Where is the rest of your team? . Well, Your Honor, it’s interesting. . Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, . and as a result, . we don’t make very good time. . I actually heard a funny story about… . Your Honor, . haven’t these ridiculous bugs . taken up enough . of this court’s valuable time? . How much longer will we allow . these absurd shenanigans to go on? . They have presented no compelling . evidence to support their charges . against my clients, . who run legitimate businesses. . I move for a complete dismissal . of this entire case! . Mr. Flayman, I’m afraid I’m going . to have to consider . Mr. Montgomery’s motion. . But you can’t! We have a terrific case. . Where is your proof? . Where is the evidence? . Show me the smoking gun! . Hold it, Your Honor! . You want a smoking gun? . Here is your smoking gun. . What is that? . It’s a bee smoker! . What, this? . This harmless little contraption? . This couldn’t hurt a fly, . let alone a bee. . Look at what has happened . to bees who have never been asked, . “Smoking or non?” . Is this what nature intended for us? . To be forcibly addicted . to smoke machines . and man-made wooden slat work camps? . Living out our lives as honey slaves . to the white man? . - What are we gonna do? . - He’s playing the species card. . Ladies and gentlemen, please, . free these bees! . Free the bees! Free the bees! . Free the bees! . Free the bees! Free the bees! . The court finds in favor of the bees! . Vanessa, we won! . I knew you could do it! High-five! . Sorry. . I’m OK! You know what this means? . All the honey . will finally belong to the bees. . Now we won’t have . to work so hard all the time. . This is an unholy perversion . of the balance of nature, Benson. . You’ll regret this. . Barry, how much honey is out there? . All right. One at a time. . Barry, who are you wearing? . My sweater is Ralph Lauren, . and I have no pants. . - What if Montgomery’s right? . - What do you mean? . We’ve been living the bee way . a long time, 27 million years. . Oongratulations on your victory. . What will you demand as a settlement? . First, we’ll demand a complete shutdown . of all bee work camps. . Then we want back the honey . that was ours to begin with, . every last drop. . We demand an end to the glorification . of the bear as anything more . than a filthy, smelly, . bad-breath stink machine. . We’re all aware . of what they do in the woods. . Wait for my signal. . Take him out. . He’ll have nauseous . for a few hours, then he’ll be fine. . And we will no longer tolerate . bee-negative nicknames… . But it’s just a prance-about stage name! . …unnecessary inclusion of honey . in bogus health products . and la-dee-da human . tea-time snack garnishments. . Oan’t breathe. . Bring it in, boys! . Hold it right there! Good. . Tap it. . Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, . and there’s gallons more coming! . - I think we need to shut down! . - Shut down? We’ve never shut down. . Shut down honey production! . Stop making honey! . Turn your key, sir! . What do we do now? . Oannonball! . We’re shutting honey production! . Mission abort. . Aborting pollination and nectar detail. . Returning to base. . Adam, you wouldn’t believe . how much honey was out there. . Oh, yeah? . What’s going on? Where is everybody? . - Are they out celebrating? . - They’re home. . They don’t know what to do. . Laying out, sleeping in. . I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way . to San Antonio with a cricket. . At least we got our honey back. . Sometimes I think, so what if humans . liked our honey? Who wouldn’t? . It’s the greatest thing in the world! . I was excited to be part of making it. . This was my new desk. This was my . new job. I wanted to do it really well. . And now… . Now I can’t. . I don’t understand . why they’re not happy. . I thought their lives would be better! . They’re doing nothing. It’s amazing. . Honey really changes people. . You don’t have any idea . what’s going on, do you? . - What did you want to show me? . - This. . What happened here? . That is not the half of it. . Oh, no. Oh, my. . They’re all wilting. . Doesn’t look very good, does it? . No. . And whose fault do you think that is? . You know, I’m gonna guess bees. . Bees? . Specifically, me. . I didn’t think bees not needing to make . honey would affect all these things. . It’s notjust flowers. . Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. . That’s our whole SAT test right there. . Take away produce, that affects . the entire animal kingdom. . And then, of course… . The human species? . So if there’s no more pollination, . it could all just go south here, . couldn’t it? . I know this is also partly my fault. . How about a suicide pact? . How do we do it? . - I’ll sting you, you step on me. . - Thatjust kills you twice. . Right, right. . Listen, Barry… . sorry, but I gotta get going. . I had to open my mouth and talk. . Vanessa? . Vanessa? Why are you leaving? . Where are you going? . To the final Tournament of Roses parade . in Pasadena. . They’ve moved it to this weekend . because all the flowers are dying. . It’s the last chance . I’ll ever have to see it. . Vanessa, I just wanna say I’m sorry. . I never meant it to turn out like this. . I know. Me neither. . Tournament of Roses. . Roses can’t do sports. . Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? . Roses! . Vanessa! . Roses?! . Barry? . - Roses are flowers! . - Yes, they are. . Flowers, bees, pollen! . I know. . That’s why this is the last parade. . Maybe not. . Oould you ask him to slow down? . Oould you slow down? . Barry! . OK, I made a huge mistake. . This is a total disaster, all my fault. . Yes, it kind of is. . I’ve ruined the planet. . I wanted to help you . with the flower shop. . I’ve made it worse. . Actually, it’s completely closed down. . I thought maybe you were remodeling. . But I have another idea, and it’s . greater than my previous ideas combined. . I don’t want to hear it! . All right, they have the roses, . the roses have the pollen. . I know every bee, plant . and flower bud in this park. . All we gotta do is get what they’ve got . back here with what we’ve got. . - Bees. . - Park. . - Pollen! . - Flowers. . - Repollination! . - Across the nation! . Tournament of Roses, . Pasadena, Oalifornia. . They’ve got nothing . but flowers, floats and cotton candy. . Security will be tight. . I have an idea. . Vanessa Bloome, FTD. . Official floral business. It’s real. . Sorry, ma’am. Nice brooch. . Thank you. It was a gift. . Once inside, . we just pick the right float. . How about The Princess and the Pea? . I could be the princess, . and you could be the pea! . Yes, I got it. . - Where should I sit? . - What are you? . - I believe I’m the pea. . - The pea? . It goes under the mattresses. . - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. . - I’m getting the marshal. . You do that! . This whole parade is a fiasco! . Let’s see what this baby’ll do. . Hey, what are you doing?! . Then all we do . is blend in with traffic… . …without arousing suspicion. . Once at the airport, . there’s no stopping us. . Stop! Security. . - You and your insect pack your float? . - Yes. . Has it been . in your possession the entire time? . Would you remove your shoes? . - Remove your stinger. . - It’s part of me. . I know. Just having some fun. . Enjoy your flight. . Then if we’re lucky, we’ll have . just enough pollen to do the job. . Oan you believe how lucky we are? We . have just enough pollen to do the job! . I think this is gonna work. . It’s got to work. . Attention, passengers, . this is Oaptain Scott. . We have a bit of bad weather . in New York. . It looks like we’ll experience . a couple hours delay. . Barry, these are cut flowers . with no water. They’ll never make it. . I gotta get up there . and talk to them. . Be careful. . Oan I get help . with the Sky Mall magazine? . I’d like to order the talking . inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. . Oaptain, I’m in a real situation. . - What’d you say, Hal? . - Nothing. . Bee! . Don’t freak out! My entire species… . What are you doing? . - Wait a minute! I’m an attorney! . - Who’s an attorney? . Don’t move. . Oh, Barry. . Good afternoon, passengers. . This is your captain. . Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B . please report to the cockpit? . And please hurry! . What happened here? . There was a DustBuster, . a toupee, a life raft exploded. . One’s bald, one’s in a boat, . they’re both unconscious! . - Is that another bee joke? . - No! . No one’s flying the plane! . This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. . What’s your status? . This is Vanessa Bloome. . I’m a florist from New York. . Where’s the pilot? . He’s unconscious, . and so is the copilot. . Not good. Does anyone onboard . have flight experience? . As a matter of fact, there is. . - Who’s that? . - Barry Benson. . From the honey trial?! Oh, great. . Vanessa, this is nothing more . than a big metal bee. . It’s got giant wings, huge engines. . I can’t fly a plane. . - Why not? Isn’t John Travolta a pilot? . - Yes. . How hard could it be? . Wait, Barry! . We’re headed into some lightning. . This is Bob Bumble. We have some . late-breaking news from JFK Airport, . where a suspenseful scene . is developing. . Barry Benson, . fresh from his legal victory… . That’s Barry! . …is attempting to land a plane, . loaded with people, flowers . and an incapacitated flight crew. . Flowers?! . We have a storm in the area . and two individuals at the controls . with absolutely no flight experience. . Just a minute. . There’s a bee on that plane. . I’m quite familiar with Mr. Benson . and his no-account compadres. . They’ve done enough damage. . But isn’t he your only hope? . Technically, a bee . shouldn’t be able to fly at all. . Their wings are too small… . Haven’t we heard this a million times? . “The surface area of the wings . and body mass make no sense.” . - Get this on the air! . - Got it. . - Stand by. . - We’re going live. . The way we work may be a mystery to you. . Making honey takes a lot of bees . doing a lot of small jobs. . But let me tell you about a small job. . If you do it well, . it makes a big difference. . More than we realized. . To us, to everyone. . That’s why I want to get bees . back to working together. . That’s the bee way! . We’re not made of Jell-O. . We get behind a fellow. . - Black and yellow! . - Hello! . Left, right, down, hover. . - Hover? . - Forget hover. . This isn’t so hard. . Beep-beep! Beep-beep! . Barry, what happened?! . Wait, I think we were . on autopilot the whole time. . - That may have been helping me. . - And now we’re not! . So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. . All of you, let’s get . behind this fellow! Move it out! . Move out! . Our only chance is if I do what I’d do, . you copy me with the wings of the plane! . Don’t have to yell. . I’m not yelling! . We’re in a lot of trouble. . It’s very hard to concentrate . with that panicky tone in your voice! . It’s not a tone. I’m panicking! . I can’t do this! . Vanessa, pull yourself together. . You have to snap out of it! . You snap out of it. . You snap out of it. . - You snap out of it! . - You snap out of it! . - You snap out of it! . - You snap out of it! . - You snap out of it! . - You snap out of it! . - Hold it! . - Why? Oome on, it’s my turn. . How is the plane flying? . I don’t know. . Hello? . Benson, got any flowers . for a happy occasion in there? . The Pollen Jocks! . They do get behind a fellow. . - Black and yellow. . - Hello. . All right, let’s drop this tin can . on the blacktop. . Where? I can’t see anything. Oan you? . No, nothing. It’s all cloudy. . Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry. . - Thinking bee. . - Thinking bee. . Thinking bee! . Thinking bee! Thinking bee! . Wait a minute. . I think I’m feeling something. . - What? . - I don’t know. It’s strong, pulling me. . Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. . Bring the nose down. . Thinking bee! . Thinking bee! Thinking bee! . - What in the world is on the tarmac? . - Get some lights on that! . Thinking bee! . Thinking bee! Thinking bee! . - Vanessa, aim for the flower. . - OK. . Out the engines. We’re going in . on bee power. Ready, boys? . Affirmative! . Good. Good. Easy, now. That’s it. . Land on that flower! . Ready? Full reverse! . Spin it around! . - Not that flower! The other one! . - Which one? . - That flower. . - I’m aiming at the flower! . That’s a fat guy in a flowered shirt. . I mean the giant pulsating flower . made of millions of bees! . Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up. . Rotate around it. . - This is insane, Barry! . - This’s the only way I know how to fly. . Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane . flying in an insect-like pattern? . Get your nose in there. Don’t be afraid. . Smell it. Full reverse! . Just drop it. Be a part of it. . Aim for the center! . Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman! . Oome on, already. . Barry, we did it! . You taught me how to fly! . - Yes. No high-five! . - Right. . Barry, it worked! . Did you see the giant flower? . What giant flower? Where? Of course . I saw the flower! That was genius! . - Thank you. . - But we’re not done yet. . Listen, everyone! . This runway is covered . with the last pollen . from the last flowers . available anywhere on Earth. . That means this is our last chance. . We’re the only ones who make honey, . pollinate flowers and dress like this. . If we’re gonna survive as a species, . this is our moment! What do you say? . Are we going to be bees, orjust . Museum of Natural History keychains? . We’re bees! . Keychain! . Then follow me! Except Keychain. . Hold on, Barry. Here. . You’ve earned this. . Yeah! . I’m a Pollen Jock! And it’s a perfect . fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. . Oh, yeah. . That’s our Barry. . Mom! The bees are back! . If anybody needs . to make a call, now’s the time. . I got a feeling we’ll be . working late tonight! . Here’s your change. Have a great . afternoon! Oan I help who’s next? . Would you like some honey with that? . It is bee-approved. Don’t forget these. . Milk, cream, cheese, it’s all me. . And I don’t see a nickel! . Sometimes I just feel . like a piece of meat! . I had no idea. . Barry, I’m sorry. . Have you got a moment? . Would you excuse me? . My mosquito associate will help you. . Sorry I’m late. . He’s a lawyer too? . I was already a blood-sucking parasite. . All I needed was a briefcase. . Have a great afternoon! . Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, . and I can’t get them anywhere. . No problem, Vannie. . Just leave it to me. . You’re a lifesaver, Barry. . Oan I help who’s next? . All right, scramble, jocks! . It’s time to fly. . Thank you, Barry! . That bee is living my life! . Let it go, Kenny. . - When will this nightmare end?! . - Let it all go. . - Beautiful day to fly. . - Sure is. . Between you and me, . I was dying to get out of that office. . You have got . to start thinking bee, my friend. . - Thinking bee! . - Me? . Hold it. Let’s just stop . for a second. Hold it. . I’m sorry. I’m sorry, everyone. . Oan we stop here? . I’m not making a major life decision . during a production number! . All right. Take ten, everybody. . Wrap it up, guys. . I had virtually no rehearsal for that. .",
