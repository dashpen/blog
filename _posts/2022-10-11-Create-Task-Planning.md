# Blackjack

I already made a simple version of Blackjack, but for the final project I will make it follow the rules better and add images to it.

# Mario

I am also planning on making a simple platformer with jumping and falling physics.

# Purpose
The purpose of these games is for entertainment, and to help me learn to code. It will go along with the other games on our group website.
