This site was really interesting as it showed me an interesting way of keeping persistent data with a database

I liked the unique idea of a chatroom with this site

I also took a look at some other people's projects outside of computer science

In all I thought that it was an interesting experience seeing what everybody did for their project and it showed me new ways of looking at how a database could work
