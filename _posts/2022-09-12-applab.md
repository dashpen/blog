# The Plan
<br>

## Questions
I was thinking about using random number generation to make one of the questions impossible to predict. I thought this would be a fun challenge and it works well. The other two questions are not random
## Design
Instead of using the Design page, I decided to use Google Drawings to make my Blog, and then import the images into the code. I had to change the dimensions of the drawing in order to make it fit perfectly in the phone template.

## Problems
The first question went by really quick, but then I realized I needed two more, and I had to restructure my code in order to allow more questions. I really struggled with the block code format as it made it hard to visualize my code.
