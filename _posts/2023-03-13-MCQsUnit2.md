My total was:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/msqs/mcqtotal.png "An image")
I am overall pretty happy with the score, but a lot of the questions were pretty bad and I didn't know how to answer a large number of these

The first question I got wrong was
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/msqs/mcq1.png "An image")

I disagree with this because getting someone's IP adress is extremely powerful in this day and age. With an IP adress you could literally find out where someone lives and impersonate them in certain circumstances. It would be very bad if someone got certification cookies like passwords, I guess though. IDK tho lmao

The second question I got wrong was
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/msqs/mcq2.png "An image")

This question, along with many others, I got wrong because I don't have a solid understanding of how the web works on a high level. It is a gap in knowledge I will have to bridge in the coming weeks and months

The third question I got wrong was 
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/msqs/mcq3.png "An image")

I completely disagree with this answer. Newspapers and articles are literally free now and you don't even need to get out of bed to read them. How is that not more acessible. Also, credibility has been seen in shambles as misinformation racks echochambers (social media) all over the internet. Yes it is easier to get information nowadays, but that doesn't mean it's correct or that all (or even a few) news publications post the right stuff.

The fourth question I got wrong was 
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/msqs/mcq4.png "An image")

These types of problems where you have to work through the code are a little hard for me to get through, so they are going to be another thing I practice in the coming weeks of the AP test

The fifth question I got wrong was 
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/msqs/mcq5.png "An image")

I guess I didn't read my answer fully, as going through it again shows that d is clearly the correct answer

The sixth question I got wrong was 
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/msqs/mcq6.png "An image")

I am going to have to watch out for college board through curveballs like this. I don't even think i considered d an option in the moment.

The seventh question I got wrong was 
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/msqs/mcq7.png "An image")

Binary search is another gap in my knoledge that I will have to overcome, and thanks to this practice test I have identified that it will be important for me to go over.
