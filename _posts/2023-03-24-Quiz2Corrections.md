My total was:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/msq2/total.png "An image")
I am overall pretty happy with the score but wish i got some more right

The first question I got wrong was
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/msq2/1.png "An image")

I disagree with this because college board is just wrong. You can definitely use the two spreadsheets and find who in the sports spreadsheet is not in the gpa spreadsheet and get the same information

The second question I got wrong was
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/msq2/2.png "An image")

I read this question wrong and thought it was asking about what could only be got with metadata, not the opposite

The third question I got wrong was 
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/msq2/3.png "An image")

For this question I didn't read all of the answers, and if I had I probably would have gotten it right.
