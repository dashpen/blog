# Week 20

## 5.1 / 5.2
- Dopamine can be a good way to relax but the overindulgence of it can lead to harmful effects
### Chatgpt
- May disrupst existing industries (art, writing, etc)
- Can be prone to bias
### Reflection
- Three beneficial effects of my computing
    - Brings people together through shared gaming
    - Teaches about gambling and how you lose all the time
    - Brings entertainment to thoseo who play it
- One detriment of my computing
    - Player may want to play a game too much
- Pros/Cons of Internet blockers
    -Pros:
        - Keeps students focused
        - Can keep less tech-savvy students safe from malicious sites
    -Cons:
        - Can block sites students need to use that are productive (think aws sites)
- The Digital Divide
    - I feel like the real digital divide is the difference between having a computer and the Internet and not having a computer. If you have a computer it is not that much different than having a really powerful computer, but faster internet speeds make a bigger difference. I think where we live the digital divide is pretty insignificant, but I am talking from a point of privilege. 




## Create Performance Task Plan
- In order to get the maximum points on a CPT review you need to have:
    - A visual way to demonstrate your code (video)
    - A purpose written correctly
    - A list that manages complexity
    - Functions that help the program flow
        - These functions need to have parameters and run differently with different parameters
- The part of our project I will use is blackjack code that I made for another project. I checked and this code satisfies all of the above conditions and it will fit well in our page of games.
- Since I already made the code, all I have to do is style it to fit our new website and choose what parts I want to showcase for the CPT write-up
- The plan is to play the game and show the cards popping up and the different inputs I acan use

## College Board MCQs

On this assignment, I got a 49/50 on the quiz as seen below: <br>

<br>
The only question I got wrong is pictured below: <br>
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mcquestion.png "The question I got wrong")
<br>
As it stands, my answer is incorrect because the correct starting condition is wrong, as a circle cannot be made with a radius of 0. The circles are always one behind. To make this correct I need to fix the starting condition at the start of the loop, which is what the correct answer does.
