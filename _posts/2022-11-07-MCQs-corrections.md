# Questions

## Q11 - How nested loops with lists function

To be honest, this questions was so badly worded an confusing to understand that I gave up on trying to understand it after a couple of minutes. The pseudo code didn't help either with understanding.

## Q16 - How information is transmitted on the Internet

I forgot or didn't learn a lot of the internet content, which is something I should probably go over again.

## Q17 - Purpose of Internet protocols

Mostly the same deal with Q16

## Q35 - Set maxPS based on time

The answer I picked was just wrong, and I also didn't see that you had to pick 2 answers.
