<p>One group I saw that was fun was a group that made a word definition finder using an api. I could look at any word I wanted to and it was a fun way to see apis in use.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#csa-group" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CSA group</h1>

<p>I also saw some groups from CSA, and one was a group that used data extensively. They made a database where you could input numbers and the site would give you information about that list of numbers. The most interesting part was the fact that all of the people who put numbers in had they data saved in an API, and you just had to find it to access it again.</p>
