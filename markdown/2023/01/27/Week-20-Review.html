  <li>Three beneficial effects of my computing
    <ul>
      <li>Brings people together through shared gaming</li>
      <li>Teaches about gambling and how you lose all the time</li>
      <li>Brings entertainment to thoseo who play it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>One detriment of my computing
    <ul>
      <li>Player may want to play a game too much</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pros/Cons of Internet blockers
  -Pros:
      - Keeps students focused
      - Can keep less tech-savvy students safe from malicious sites
  -Cons:
      - Can block sites students need to use that are productive (think aws sites)</li>
  <li>The Digital Divide
    <ul>
      <li>I feel like the real digital divide is the difference between having a computer and the Internet and not having a computer. If you have a computer it is not that much different than having a really powerful computer, but faster internet speeds make a bigger difference. I think where we live the digital divide is pretty insignificant, but I am talking from a point of privilege.</li>

<ul>
  <li>In order to get the maximum points on a CPT review you need to have:
    <ul>
      <li>A visual way to demonstrate your code (video)</li>
      <li>A purpose written correctly</li>
      <li>A list that manages complexity</li>
      <li>Functions that help the program flow
        <ul>
          <li>These functions need to have parameters and run differently with different parameters</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The part of our project I will use is blackjack code that I made for another project. I checked and this code satisfies all of the above conditions and it will fit well in our page of games.</li>
  <li>Since I already made the code, all I have to do is style it to fit our new website and choose what parts I want to showcase for the CPT write-up</li>
  <li>The plan is to play the game and show the cards popping up and the different inputs I acan use</li>

<p>On this assignment, I got a 49/50 on the quiz as seen below: <br>
<img src="/blog/images/msq2.png" alt="" title="My Quiz Results">
<br>
The only question I got wrong is pictured below: <br>
<img src="/blog/images/mcquestion.png" alt="" title="The question I got wrong">
<br>
As it stands, my answer is incorrect because the correct starting condition is wrong, as a circle cannot be made with a radius of 0. The circles are always one behind. To make this correct I need to fix the starting condition at the start of the loop, which is what the correct answer does.</p>
